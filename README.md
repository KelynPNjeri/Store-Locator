### Store Locator
Store Locator is an app that utilizes the power of the Mapbox map API to be able to create a simple map application that allows businesses to add their stores to the map which in turn makes the businesses more accessible to potential customers.

#### Technologies Used
To build the Store Locator, we used the following technologies:
- Android/Java
- Mapbox Android SDK
- Navigation SDK
This app uses the MVC (Model View Controller) architecture. Whereby all our data related classes are found in the model package while views is concerned with what the user views when on the app and the controller acts as an intermediary between the model and view.
